The tool requires external documentation for basic operations.\n\n## Context\nAn AI agent (Claude) tried to add a KB entry and hit multiple friction points:\n1. `--category` required but not obvious from help\n2. Duplicate detection blocked with misleading \"use --force\" message\n3. No way to discover KB location to work around issues\n4. Had to hunt for `$MEMEX_KB_ROOT` env var\n\n## Proposed Improvements\n\n### 1. Improve `mx add --help` output\nShow required params prominently with examples:\n```\nRequired:\n  --title TEXT     Entry title\n  --tags TEXT      Tags (comma-separated)\n  --category TEXT  Category (one of: infrastructure, devops, tooling, ...)\n                   Tip: often matches primary tag\n\nCommon issues:\n  - Duplicate detected? Use --force to override\n  - Need KB location? Run: mx info\n```\n\n### 2. Better error messages with actionable suggestions\nInstead of:\n```\nError: Either 'category' or 'directory' must be provided.\nExisting categories: best-practices, development, ...\n```\n\nShow:\n```\nError: --category required.\n\nYour tags: infrastructure, proxmox\nSuggested: --category=infrastructure\n\nAvailable categories: best-practices, development, tooling, projects, devops, infrastructure\n\nExample: mx add --title=\"...\" --tags=\"infrastructure,proxmox\" --category=infrastructure --content=\"...\"\n```\n\n### 3. Self-documenting discoverability\n- `mx info` command showing KB root, categories, stats (see voidlabs-kb-51mz)\n- `mx add --dry-run` to preview before committing (see voidlabs-kb-7tv)\n\n## Design Principle\nA well-designed CLI shouldn't need extensive external documentation for basic operations.
