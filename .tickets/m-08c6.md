# mx search crashes when whoosh is missing

Focusgroup agents all hit ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whoosh' when running mx search. This blocks onboarding because search is in quick-start. Provide a friendly error and/or a graceful fallback, or ensure dependency is installed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] mx search fails gracefully when whoosh is not installed (no stack trace)\n- [ ] Error message explains how to install search deps (e.g., memex-kb[search])\n- [ ] Quick-start/docs reflect optional search dependency
