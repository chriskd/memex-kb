# Fix pyright errors in publisher recent sorting

Pyright fails on src/memex/publisher/templates.py because _recent_sort_key returns datetime | None and is used as the sorted key (lines ~160, ~691). This blocks release quality gates. Ensure sort key always returns a comparable datetime (e.g., fallback to datetime.min) or filter None.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] pyright passes with no errors\n- [ ] Recent list sorting still prefers updated over created\n- [ ] Index page recent entries sorting still correct\n- [ ] Add/update tests if needed
