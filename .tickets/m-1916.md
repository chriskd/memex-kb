# Silence CLI test coroutine warnings

Pytest emits 'coroutine ... was never awaited' when CLI tests patch run_async and pass async core coroutines. Should close coroutines or adjust run_async mocking to avoid warnings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI tests run without un-awaited coroutine warnings\n- [ ] Approach documented in test helpers or fixture
