# mx prime: show active KB path + primary category

Expose resolved KB path, scope, and primary category in mx prime/mx info for faster onboarding.

## Notes

**2026-02-06**

- `mx info` now prints `Primary Scope` and always prints `Primary` (including `(not set)`), plus includes `primary_scope` in JSON.
- `mx prime --json` now includes `kb_root`, `kb_scope`, `primary_category`, `context_file`. When session-context is unavailable, the text output includes a short context snapshot section.
