# Docs: align installation guidance with semantic deps/extras

Docs mention memex-kb[semantic] and ‘minimal vs full’ installs, but pyproject.toml has no extras. Installation guidance is inconsistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Either define extras in packaging or update docs to state semantic search is included by default\n- [ ] README.md and kb/guides/installation.md updated accordingly\n- [ ] Install examples verified
