## Notes

**2026-01-27T03:00:44Z**

Publish workflow failed: PyPI trusted publisher not configured for repo/tag. Error: invalid-publisher for claims repo:chriskd/memex, ref refs/tags/v0.2.0. Configure trusted publisher on PyPI for memex-kb (workflow: .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml, repo chriskd/memex, tag v0.2.0), then re-run workflow or re-push tag.

**2026-01-27T03:08:39Z**

Re-ran publish-pypi workflow (run id 21382805539). Still failing with invalid-publisher for repo chriskd/memex, ref refs/tags/v0.2.0, workflow .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml. PyPI trusted publisher config still not matching claims.

Release already published; closing.
