# Add frontmatter or exclude chat-gpt-5.2-pro-dense-memory-signals reference

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File has valid frontmatter (title/tags at minimum) OR is excluded via .kbconfig\n- [ ] mx reindex runs without warning for this entry\n- [ ] Search includes or intentionally ignores this entry
